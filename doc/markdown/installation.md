## Installation

This package can be added to any [ROS2 workspace].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricmua/ros_spheres_environment.git path/to/workspace/src/
```

ROS2 workspaces are built using [colcon], from within a 
[configured ROS2 environment].

```bash
cd path/to/workspace
source path/to/ros/setup.bash
colcon build
```

### Microsoft Windows

The above examples are tailored to Linux installations. The installation 
commands will differ slightly for the Windows Operating system.

The command to initialize a configured ROS2 environment uses the `call` 
function on a `setup.bat`, instead of `source` on `setup.bash`. The path to the 
ROS2 installation will likely also differ.

```
call path/to/ros/setup.bat
```

The `--merge-install` [colcon build flag] is recommended:

> for workspaces with many packages otherwise the environment variables might 
  exceed the supported maximum length.

```
colcon build --merge-install
```
